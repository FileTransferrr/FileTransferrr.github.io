I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Analog and Mixed-signal circuit design, analog design automation and VLSI circuit design.

I have been working with the [PRIME Lab](https://tangresearch.top) from [School of Integrated Circuit](https://ic.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, under the supervision of Prof.Xiyuan Tang since September 2024. In September 2025, I joined Rice University in Houston, Texas as a visiting student. There I worked with the [SIMS Lab](https://vlsi.rice.edu) under the supervision of Prof. Kaiyuan Yang, and I conducted low-power analog 
front-end design.
